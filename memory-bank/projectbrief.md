# Project Brief: Office Document Translator - Enhanced Edition

## Core Mission
Create a streamlined, multi-lingual document translation system for Microsoft Office files (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) that preserves formatting while providing accurate translations between six major languages: Japanese, English, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese (Simplified), and Korean.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Streamlined Office Support
- **Excel**: Spreadsheets with complex formulas, charts, shapes, and data
- **Word**: Documents with tables, headers, footers, and embedded content  
- **PowerPoint**: Presentations with SmartArt, WordArt, complex shapes, and multimedia
- **Focus**: Removed PDF support for optimized performance and reliability

### 2. Enhanced Multi-Language Capabilities
- **Six-language support**: Japanese, English, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese (Simplified), Korean
- **Advanced translation engine** with context-aware processing
- **Batch processing** for efficient large-scale translation
- **Technical terminology preservation** across all language pairs

### 3. Format Preservation & User Experience
- **Original document structure** maintained completely
- **Visual formatting** (fonts, colors, layouts) preserved
- **Complex elements** (charts, diagrams, embedded objects) handled properly
- **Modern colorful UI** with professional status indicators

## Key Requirements

### Technical
- Support for modern and legacy Office formats (.xls/.xlsx, .doc/.docx, .ppt/.pptx)
- Windows-optimized with cross-platform Python compatibility
- Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- Silent dependency management with progress indication

### User Experience  
- **Enhanced batch file interface** with colorful, modern UI
- **Hidden technical complexity** - users see only progress and results
- **Interactive language selection** with visual flags and clear options
- **Professional status messaging** with âœ“, !, ERROR, INFO indicators

### Language Support
- **Source Languages**: Auto-detection from any of the six supported languages
- **Target Languages**: Japanese (ja), Vietnamese (vi), English (en), Thai (th), Chinese Simplified (zh), Korean (ko)
- **Bidirectional support**: Any language to any other language with full context preservation

## Success Criteria
1. **Reliability**: 95%+ successful translation rate across all Office document types
2. **Coverage**: Handle complex elements (SmartArt, WordArt, OLE objects) that basic tools miss
3. **Quality**: Professional-grade output maintaining original formatting
4. **Usability**: Intuitive colorful interface accessible to non-technical users
5. **Performance**: Fast, streamlined processing without heavy dependencies

## Project Scope
- **In Scope**: Microsoft Office document translation with advanced element support and six-language capabilities
- **Recently Removed**: PDF processing for streamlined performance and faster installation
- **Enhanced**: Modern UI, three additional Asian languages, improved user experience
- **Out of Scope**: Other document formats, real-time translation, web interface
